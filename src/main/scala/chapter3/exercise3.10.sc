Our implementation of foldRight is not tail-recursive and will
result in a StackOverflowError for large lists (we say itâ€™s not
stack-safe). Convince yourself that this is the case, and then
write another general list-recursion function, foldLeft, that is
tail-recursive, using the techniques we discussed in the previous chapter.
