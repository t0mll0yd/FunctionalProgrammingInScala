/*
Can product, implemented using foldRight, immediately halt
the recursion and return 0.0 if it encounters a 0.0? Why or
why not? Consider how any short-circuiting might work if you
call foldRight with a large list. This is a deeper question
that weâ€™ll return to in chapter 5.

/*
product, using foldRight, cannot short-circuit as foldRight does
not have any short-circuit mechanisms built in.
